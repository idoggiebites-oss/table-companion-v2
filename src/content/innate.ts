/**
 * Spells an ancestry hands you.
 *
 * Ported from V1's `domain/innate.ts`. 119 of 605 ancestries grant one, and
 * **36 grant one at a LATER level** — a drow knows Dancing Lights and gains
 * Faerie Fire at 3rd, a tiefling knows Thaumaturgy and gains Hellish Rebuke.
 * The trait was shown as prose and the spell never reached the spell list, so
 * a tiefling arrived at the table unable to cast the one thing their ancestry
 * is known for, and nothing on any screen said why.
 *
 * This is also the whole of racial *progression*: an ancestry is not a thing
 * that stops mattering after level one.
 *
 * Three shapes, all near-boilerplate, which is what makes reading them safe:
 *
 *   "You know the dancing lights cantrip."
 *   "When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day"
 *   "You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list."
 *
 * The third is a choice rather than a grant, and is reported as one — the app
 * should ask, not pick.
