/**
 * What a background actually gives you.
 *
 * Ported from V1's `domain/background.ts`. V1's builder had asked for "two of
 * your choice — languages or tools, in any mix", which is a rule no edition
 * has. In 2014 the BACKGROUND decides: an acolyte gets two languages and no
 * tools, a criminal gets two tools and no languages, a guild artisan gets one
 * of each. Offering the choice let a criminal walk away speaking Draconic and
 * knowing no trade.
 *
 * No compendium marks any of this structurally. It is in the background's own
 * text, in near-boilerplate lines — "Languages: Two of your choice", "Tool
 * Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves' tools" — which is what makes
 * reading them safe, and what makes saying the reading out loud in the builder
 * necessary when it comes up thin.
