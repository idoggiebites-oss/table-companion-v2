/**
 * Web Push, by hand.
 *
 * There is no library here for the same reason there is no framework: the
 * whole of it is three standards and Web Crypto, which the runtime already
 * has, and a dependency that ships its own crypto is a dependency that has to
 * be trusted with the keys.
 *
 *   RFC 8292 (VAPID)  — a signed JWT proving who is asking the push service
 *                       to deliver, so the endpoint is not an open relay.
 *   RFC 8291 (aes128gcm) — the payload is encrypted to a key pair the
 *                       BROWSER generated. The push service carries it and
 *                       cannot read it; nor can this Worker after the fact.
 *   RFC 8188 (content encoding) — the framing those two agree on.
 *
 * The private key lives in a secret. Without it the whole feature is off,
 * which is deliberate: a deployment with no key sends nothing rather than
 * failing at the moment somebody's turn comes round.
 *
 * Ported from V1 unchanged: it is three standards and Web Crypto, and there
 * was nothing in it to re-derive.
 *
 * **No `nodejs_compat`.** V2's wrangler.jsonc omits the flag with a note
 * saying to add it with whatever first needs a node builtin — and this, the
 * thing everyone assumes needs it, does not. It imports nothing at all:
 * `crypto.subtle`, `TextEncoder`, `btoa`/`atob` are workerd natives. Checked
 * rather than copied.
